# This repository contains all my hands-on experiments on gathering an understanding of Socket Programming and related 
# concepts. The many lessons learnt are as follows:
# 1. Implementation of fork to create concurrent processes
# 2. Implementation of execve to run a new process in a completely different parent process
# 3. Implementation of a simple connection oriented client-server connection (TCP)
# 4. Implementation of a simple connection less client-server connection (UDP)
# 5. Implementation of concurrent server models, using fork(), select() and other synchronized I/O methods and pthread and comparison of these implementations with the normal implementation.
# 6. Implementation of master-slave process included in the TCPdaytime server model where a new child process is created to handle each incoming request. 
# 7. Understood the various race condition possibilities while and with out mutexes and conditional variables. Fixed few race conditions with the appropriate fixes.
# 8. Developed an understanding of Socket Options and how they can be used
